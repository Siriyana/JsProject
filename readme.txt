Project 1: Training Counter

Description:
The app is in Finnish.

On this app, you can keep count of your exercises. You "log in", aka give your name and email address and after that, you can add, update or delete information about your exercises. The app will keep track of how many exercises you have logged, what are the total duration and average duration of your exercises and also show you the exercises by categories.

You can choose the visual theme from four different options to make your site feel more you.
